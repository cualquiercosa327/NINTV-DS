ISTAR
(c)2010 DAVID AKERS

This game started out as a set
of programs called DSTAR for the
TI graphical calculators created
by Joe Wingbermuehle and Andrew
Von Dollen. The Intellivision
conversion includes the 25 
"classic" levels from the TI-83
calculator version, plus 11 all
new levels.

CONTROLS:
---------
Press 7 to select level
Press 9 on the keypad while
playing the game to switch to an
editor. You can edit your own
level and test it out.
Unfortunately there is no way to
save your level.
